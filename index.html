                    <p>The Maoli Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) Native Hawaiian Organization (NHO) that wholly owns for-profit subsidiaries primarily engaged in state and federal contracting services. The returns generated from the operations of our for-profit subsidiaries are redistributed back into the Native Hawaiian community by way of charitable donations, scholarships, and seed funding. In addition to our monetary contributions, we donate a significant number of volunteer hours giving our knowledge, skills, and experience back to the community.</p>
                    <p>Our corporate culture is both idealistic and practical. We want an idea meritocracy in which meaningful work is pursued in an environment of radical transparency. We require people to be extremely open, air disagreements, test each other’s logic, and view discovering mistakes and weaknesses as a chance for improvement and innovation. It is by continually striving together for the highest levels of excellence that we are able to administer the most meaningful community impact.</p>

                    <p>Our mission is to help Native Hawaiian peoples out of positions of indigence and tribulation and into positions of affluence and prosperity. We believe that much of the existing infrastructure setup to help Native Hawaiians has been inhibited and convoluted by bureaucracy and cronyism. The Maoli Foundation is unencumbered by such impediments and makes contributions based on an equitable and efficient framework. A great deal of due diligence is performed to ensure that each investment back into the community has the greatest possible impact per dollar in the most deserving ventures.</p>

                    <p>At their essence, our values – building meaningful work and meaningful relationships, finding people who think differently, and creating an environment where the best ideas win (no matter who came up with them) – lead us to embrace diversity and treasure our differences. <span class="orphan-wrap">If our</span> mission is to have the deepest possible understanding of how global economies work, we must find and grow the best talent – across gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation/identity, <span class=" orphan-wrap">religion and more.</span></p>
                    <p>That’s why we have dedicated diversity professionals reporting directly to the CEOs, several community groups with the goal of supporting/building our diverse communities, and a senior Diversity Council empowered to drive forward our vision and plan for continuing to make Bridgewater a vibrant, <span class=" orphan-wrap">inclusive community.</span></p>

                    <p>It takes all types to make the Maoli Foundation great. If you’re someone who enjoys creating innovative ways to reach ambitious goals, who is open to and energized by receiving honest feedback, and who likes asking and being asked “why?” — then we should talk. We don’t just look for people who can help us achieve our goals. We look for people who share our vision.</p>

                    <p>Meaningful relationships are just as important as meaningful work — both are required and mutually reinforcing. So we support relationships to help them grow organically, with people having many options for getting involved in the community, if they choose to.</p>
                    <p>For example, we are now home to 87 common interest, support, diversity, and activity groups ranging from sports teams and health and wellness groups to book and car clubs and a community garden. We gather families for our big summer and Halloween parties and have many other celebrations throughout the year, including an annual TalentFest and our unique Scrum race. And we encourage people to get together on their own to do whatever interests them by helping pay for events they organize themselves.</p>
