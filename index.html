                    <p>Our unique success is the direct result of our unique way of being. We want an idea meritocracy in which meaningful work and meaningful relationships are pursued through radical truth and radical transparency. We require people to be extremely open, air disagreements, test each other’s logic, and view discovering mistakes and weaknesses as a good thing that leads to improvement and innovation. It is by continually striving together for the highest levels of truth and excellence that we create meaningful work and meaningful relationships.</p>
                    <p>We are both idealistic and practical. We believe that creating excellent outcomes requires setting ambitious goals and applying our understanding of how the world works, as reflected in principles, to achieve them. Our Principles are ways of dealing with situations. They are the evolving record of our understanding of what works well. They’re not just read and followed, but stress-tested on an individual and collective level as our shared approach to working together. As Bridgewater is an idea-meritocracy in which we value independent thinking, we urge you to read and assess them for yourself.</p>

                    <p>Bridgewater Associates is focused on understanding how the world works. By having the deepest possible understanding of the global economy and financial markets, and translating that understanding into great portfolios and strategic partnerships with institutional clients, we've built a distinct track record of success. We've done this for more than 40 years by having great people operate in a culture of radical truth and radical transparency. Today, we manage about $160 billion for approximately 350 of the largest and most sophisticated global institutional clients including public and corporate pension funds, university endowments, charitable foundations, supranational agencies, sovereign wealth funds, and central banks.</p>

                    <p>At their essence, our values – building meaningful work and meaningful relationships, finding people who think differently, and creating an environment where the best ideas win (no matter who came up with them) – lead us to embrace diversity and treasure our differences. <span class="orphan-wrap">If our</span> mission is to have the deepest possible understanding of how global economies work, we must find and grow the best talent – across gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation/identity, <span class=" orphan-wrap">religion and more.</span></p>
                    <p>That’s why we have dedicated diversity professionals reporting directly to the CEOs, several community groups with the goal of supporting/building our diverse communities, and a senior Diversity Council empowered to drive forward our vision and plan for continuing to make Bridgewater a vibrant, <span class=" orphan-wrap">inclusive community.</span></p>

                    <p>It takes all types to make Bridgewater great. If you’re someone who enjoys creating innovative ways to reach ambitious goals, who is open to and energized by receiving honest feedback, and who likes asking and being asked “why?” — then we should talk. We don’t just look for people who can do a particular job. We look for people we want to share our lives with.</p>

                    <p>Meaningful relationships are just as important as meaningful work — both are required and mutually reinforcing. So we support relationships to help them grow organically, with people having many options for getting involved in the community, if they choose to.</p>
                    <p>For example, we are now home to 87 common interest, support, diversity, and activity groups ranging from sports teams and health and wellness groups to book and car clubs and a community garden. We gather families for our big summer and Halloween parties and have many other celebrations throughout the year, including an annual TalentFest and our unique Scrum race. And we encourage people to get together on their own to do whatever interests them by helping pay for events they organize themselves.</p>
